## Assignment 4 - Classification benchmarks
**Johanne BW**

DESCRIPTION Classifier benchmarks using Logistic Regression and a Neural Network

Create two command-line tools which can be used to perform a simple classification task on the MNIST data and print the output to the terminal. 
These scripts can then be used to provide easy-to-understand benchmark scores for evaluating these models.

## How to run
**Step 1: Clone repo**
- open terminal
- Navigate to destination you want the repo
- type the following command
 ```console
 git clone 
 ```
**step 2: Set up enviroment:**
- Navigate to the folder "Assignment_4".
```console
cd cds_visual_assignments
cd Assignment_4
```  
- Use the bash script _create_assignment4_venv.sh_ to set up environment:  
```console
bash create_assignment4_venv.sh
```  
**step 3: Run the program:**
- Navigate to the folder "Assignment_4" if you are not already there
- Run the programs by running the run_lr_nn_scripts.sh where the enviroment activates and the two scripts in the src folder run
```console
bash run_lr_nn_scripts.sh
```  
**step 4: Output:**
- The two classifiers are printet on the screen
- NB: This might take some time
